My Github page is currently being used to display my CV and a small project.

I made this small BeCode project in one week : [FreeMeal](https://philemonphilippin.github.io/becode-exercises/freemeal/).

I've completed many other projects during my training to learn and exercise my knowledge of front end (without any framework).

These projects aren't very impressive, and not really original, so I've decided not to post them here.

At the moment, as part of my professional training, we're looking at React.
