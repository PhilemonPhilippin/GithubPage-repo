## What is there on this portfolio ?

This GitHub page is currently being used to display my CV and a small front end project (free meal).

## Free meal

I made this small front end BeCode project in one week.

The aim was to learn as much as possible about using an API through a user interface and styling a website, using only the most basic tools: HTML, CSS and JavaScript vanilla. No frameworks.

## Other BeCode projects

I've completed many other projects during my training to learn and to exercise my knowledge of front end. I also learned a lot about the JavaScript ecosystem and Node.js.

I don't think that these projects are very impressive, and not really original, so I've decided not to post them here. You can find them, and their source code, at this address : [BeCode](https://github.com/PhilemonPhilippin/BeCode).

The training program is now complete. As a result, I am spending most of my time looking for a 2 or 3 month unpaid internship.

The aim is to prove to myself and to my potential future employer that I can do the job, and that I can do it well.

I am also gradually returning to the .NET ecosystem, since this is the role I am aiming at as a .NET Junior Developer. To do that, I am rewriting my basic CRUD app "Kitchen" into a new, less complex and more ambitious web application : [InnoCheffing](https://github.com/PhilemonPhilippin/InnoCheffing-repo).
